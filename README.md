# Client-Server Messaging Application
 The application is based on a client server model consisting of one server and multiple messaging clients in Python. The clients communicate using TCP. The server is mainly used to authenticate the clients and direct the messages (online or offline) between clients. Besides, the server also supports certain additional functions (presence notification, blacklisting, timeout, etc.). Clients are also allowed to send peer-to-peer messages to each other that bypasses the server.
